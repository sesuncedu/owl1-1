# Scribing #

Since OWLED is a "working" workshop, most of the interesting activity takes place in the discussion. In order to capture some of this, we ask participants to "scribe" the sessions, i.e., take notes to record major points, questions, and decisions. Since this is _very_ hard on the scribe, generally people take turns. This year, in addition to having people take turns as "principle scribe" for a session, there will also be plenty of opportunity for people to collaborate on the scribing via a real time collaborative editor. At OWLED 2007, the editor will be [ACE](http://ace.iserver.ch/index.php), which is a cross-platform, real time, share space collaborative editor.

The way it will work is that someone (likely the principle scribe) will set up a new document to share at the start of each session, and anyone will be free to subscribe to the document. The syntax will be Google Code's [wiki syntax](http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax), which will enable us to publish the sessions to the web immediately.

So, please download  [ACE](http://ace.iserver.ch/index.php) and play with it. (**NOTE:** this "ACE" is an editor which has nothing to do with [Attempto Controlled English](http://owled2007.iut-velizy.uvsq.fr/PapersPDF/submission_22.pdf), which is also known as ACE.)

If you're willing to be principle scribe for a session, please drop Bijan a line. As we produce minutes, they'll be linked to from here.
