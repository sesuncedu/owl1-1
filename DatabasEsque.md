# Rationale #

There are a number of features familiar to people working with databases that either work differently in OWL (inheritence), are currently restricted (keys) or missing (integrity constraints). There is a great deal of work e.g., from the description logic community for adding variants of these features. There is also quite a bit of folk knowledge of how to work around the lack (either at the ontology level or the system level).

# Current Topics #

The TF is working on three topics at the moment:

  1. Keys (EasyKeyProposal)
  1. Constraints (aka, TBox closure)
  1. Closing some part of your knowledge base. We distinguish between
    * formalisms that allow to make general statements in your ontology and
    * query languages that allow you to query with "closing" constructs such as epistemic operators

# Dependencies #

Sometimes these features are realized in or in conjunction with rules or query languages, so SafeRules and SparqlOwl are relevant.
