#summary A list of example ontologies using OWL 1.1 features, syntax, etc.
#labels Featured

(Feel free to send Bijan pointers or examples. We can host them in svn on this server, or in a number of alternative places. Tutorial style examples are welcome.)

(An updated DAML+OIL to OWL 1.1 converter would be a great thing, since we could capture all the DAML+OIL ontologies that used qualified cardinalities correctly.)

|| Name || Syntax || Comment ||
|| [http://www.owldl.com/ontologies/family.owl family.owl]|| RDF/XML || Example ontology demoing OWL 1.1 features (by Evren Sirin)||
||[http://owl1-1.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ontologies/galen-original-owl1.1.owl Galen] ([http://owl1-1.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ontologies/galen-simplified-owl1.1.owl simplified version]) || RDF/XML|| A version of the [http://www.co-ode.org/galen/index.php Galen] biomedical ontology. It has some role inclusion axioms, e.g, involving the "hasLocation" property (submitted by Dmitry Tsarkov)||
|| [http://owl1-1.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ontologies/example-for-teijgeler-qcrs-apr2007.owl Pump] example || RDF/XML || Created by Bijan Parsia in reply to Hans Teijgeler's [http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/semantic-web/2007Apr/0067.html query]. Note that Bijan added a nonsense min cardinality in order to make the class unsatisfiable. ||
|| [http://owl1-1.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ontologies/example-for-teijgeler-qcrs-apr2007.xml Pump] example || OWL11 XML || Same as the pump example above, only in the [http://webont.org/owl/1.1/xml_syntax.html XML syntax]. The file is valid, and it contains a declaration (only one) and an axiom comment!||
