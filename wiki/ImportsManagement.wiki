= Introduction =

The Imports Management task force is chartered to produce a report on
mechanisms to support import and ontology linking in OWL.

= Participation =

Participation is open to all interested parties.  See
http://webont.org/owled/taskforces/ for more information on
participation.

= Expected Parts of the Report =

  * Options for import mechansisms

Volunteers to create or edit parts of the report are very welcome.

= Activities =

It is expected that most of the activities of the task force will play
out in public-owl-dev@w3.org.  Messages related to this task force
should be tagged with "Imports:".  Progress will be documented in this
wiki.  Results (interim and final) of the taskforce, in particular
versions of parts of the report suitable for discussion by the larger
OWLED community, will be placed in the
[http://webont.org/owled/taskforces/ WebOnt task force] pages.

If needed, there will be occasional teleconferences.  Face-to-face meetings are not expected, except, perhaps, at OWLED meetings.

= Timeline =

It would be nice to have something concrete to report at the interim
OWLED meeting in March/April 2008.  This means getting decent
documents together by January/February 2008.
