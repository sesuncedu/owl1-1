#labels OWLED,Taskforce
= Introduction =

The User Requirements Task Force  aims to identify requirements to improve the utility and deployment of the OWL language by users communities esp. in industrial organizations.


= Report =

The TF will produce a report including use cases, requirements, and recommendations to guide theoretical and application developments. Volunteers to create or edit parts of the report are very welcome. If you have an existing document that could serve as the start of part of the report, don't hesitate to bring it forward.

= Milestones =

 * Summarize main usage of OWL and OWL1.1 based on OWLED 2007 papers, and discussions stemming from the Life Sciences and Industry Panels.
 * Identify key requirements that are not met in OWL 1.1, but are essential for users communities (e.g; for the OBO biomedical community) or frequent types of applications (e.g.; for data integration). Give tightly limited examples that illustrates issues identified.
 * Generate a publishable document that illustrates by some working - small, well constrained examples - collected from use cases, how a particular feature in OWL 1.0, OWL 1.1 (e.g.; inverse functional, anti-symmetric, declaration, annotation) can/should be used
 * Define other kind of support helpful for the development of OWL ontology/applications in HCLS or industry (for example, a mailing list for OWL users, a wiki including various information e.g; on tools/software, a more intelligent system etc.), potentially in collaboration with the [Education] task force.
