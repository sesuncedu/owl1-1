#summary Page for the Databasesque features OWLED task force
#labels OWLED,Taskforce

= Rationale =

There are a number of features familiar to people working with databases that either work differently in OWL (inheritence), are currently restricted (keys) or missing (integrity constraints). There is a great deal of work e.g., from the description logic community for adding variants of these features. There is also quite a bit of folk knowledge of how to work around the lack (either at the ontology level or the system level).

= Current Topics =

The TF is working on three topics at the moment:

 # Keys
 # Constraints (aka, TBox closure)
 # ABox closure (i.e., Closed World Assumption and Unique Name assumptions)

 * Constraints

   * (Need to add classic K and A stuff.)

= Dependancies =

Sometimes these features are realized in or in conjunction with rules or query languages, so SafeRules and SparqlOwl are relevant.
