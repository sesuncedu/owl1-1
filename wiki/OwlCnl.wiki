#summary Page for the OWL/CNL OWLED task force
#labels Taskforce

= Rationale =

The mathematical nature of description logics has meant that domain experts find it hard to understand OWL-based ontologies. This forms a significant impediment to their creation and reuse. If domain experts' knowledge is to be represented and verified, an easily readable syntax for writing ontologies is needed.   

= Features =

 * Reading (rendering) and writing

= Scoping Issues =

 * Language coverage alternatives
   * All of OWL 1.1, including extralogical features, annotations, datatypes, etc.
   * Concept expression language only (with axiomatic structure indicated otherwise, e.g., by indentation)
   * Some tractable fragment(s)
   * Core OWL 1.1 axioms only (i.e., logical content only) 
 * Strict roundtrippability
 * Task - what's the language trying to do? Ontology specification, Querying and Reasoning may each be suited to different specifications.
 * Testing - how do we actually know people find it easy/easier than other syntaxes?
 
 
= Syntax Issues =
 * Data-properties can be hard to handle, see e.g. the definition of data ranges in the OWL 1.1 spec: http://webont.org/owl/1.1/owl_specification.html#4.3
 * Some OWL 1.1 axioms (e.g. DisjointUnion) are a concise notation to express a large number of axioms. At least in some cases, graphical means seem better. e.g. the pie-chart visualization of DisjointUnion that Protege 4 offers seems better than any natural language representation.
 * Long syntactic patterns - useful to convey meaning the first time, but tiresome to type 100 times...
