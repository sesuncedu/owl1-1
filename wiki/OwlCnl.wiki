= Rationale =

Many users would like to have a natural language/natural language like syntax for OWL.

= Features =

 * Reading (rendering) and writing

= Big Issues =

 * Language coverage
   * All of OWL 1.1?
   * Concept langauge
   * Some tractable fragments
   * Core OWL 1.1 axioms (no annotations etc.)
 * Strict roundtrippability
