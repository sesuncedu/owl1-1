#summary Page for the OWL/CNL OWLED task force
#labels Taskforce

= Rationale =

The mathematical nature of description logics has meant that domain experts find it hard to understand OWL-based ontologies. This forms a significant impediment to their creation and reuse. If domain experts' knowledge is to be represented and verified, an easily readable syntax for writing ontologies is needed.  

= User Requirements and Task Force Goals =

= Features =

 * Reading (rendering) and writing

= Big Issues =

 * Language coverage
   * All of OWL 1.1?
   * Concept language
   * Some tractable fragments
   * Core OWL 1.1 axioms (no annotations etc.)
 * Strict roundtrippability
 * Task - what's the language trying to do? Ontology specification, Querying and Reasoning may each be suited to different specifications.
 * Testing - how do we actually know people find it easy/easier than other syntaxes?
