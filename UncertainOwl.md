# Rationale #

Reasoning with various sorts of uncertainty is critical for many tasks from representing the results of medical experiments to working with the output of ontology alignment tools. However, there are many, many sorts of uncertainty formalisms and several active research programs working in this area. This task force will try to present the state of the area in such a way that the OWLED participants can start to understand what questions they need to ask and answer.

# Current Topics #

The TF is working on three topics at the moment:

  1. Fuzzy extensions
  1. Probabilistic extensions
  1. Possiblistic extensions

# Current Tools #

  * Fuzzy extensions
    * [FiRE](http://www.image.ece.ntua.gr/~nsimou): A fuzzy SHIN Reasoner
    * [fuzzyDL](http://gaia.isti.cnr.it/~straccia): A mixed integer programming-based SHIf fuzzy reasoner
    * [ONTOSEARCH2](http://dipper.csd.abdn.ac.uk/OntoSearch/): A fuzzy DL-Lite reasoner and query engine

  * Probabilistic extensions
  * Possiblistic extensions
