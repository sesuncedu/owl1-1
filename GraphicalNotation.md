# Introduction #

As a modelling language, it is important for OWL to have a graphical notation.

This is not to be confused with the broader area of ontology visualization, which potentially caters for a vast array of views and graphical editing facilities.

A graphical notation is simply a graphical alternative to the other OWL syntaxes.


# Graphical Notations developed for OWL #

> UML Profiles for RDF and OWL have been developed as part of OMG's [Ontology Definition Meta Model (ODM)](http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?ptc/2007-09-09).

  * The [UML Graphical Notation](UMLGraphicalNotation.md) developed within the ODM appears to be the most mature approach.
