Current project administrators are Boris Motik, Bijan Parsia, and Bernardo Cuenca Grau.

Google code deliberately does not have [fine grained access control capabilities](http://code.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=56685&topic=10386). Everything is open to every project member, including subversion access to specifications, OWLED web pages, etc.
Therefore project policy needs to be defined, to be accepted by members, and to be practiced on an individual level, as a matter of courtesy. Our policy is as follows:

  * Don't vandalize or spam Wiki pages. Consider consulting [Wikipedia policies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines) if you are uncertain about what is appropriate, or send mail to one of the admins.
  * If you wish a wiki page to be maintained in a certain way, please include a note at the top or bottom of the page saying "Maintained by  <your name and email> <your policy>". If you come upon a page that has such a notice, contact the maintainer before editing the page in a way that might violate the policy. A common policy is that only typo correction is desired. In this case, only make genuinely editorial corrections. Each page has the ability to add comments via the comments box, so that route for commentary is always available.
  * Be restrictive in your policy for wiki page editing only for very good reasons. The default should be free access.
  * Don't commit to the subversion repository unless you have been delegated to do so by the admins. In particular, don't add new projects, large files, etc. to the repository without checking first.
  * Basically, be nice and make efforts to avoid misunderstanding.
  * If you have a complaint about something involving the project contact one of the admins, explain the situation, and they will help resolve the issue.
  * Administrators work with the OWLED steering committee. If you are unhappy with a decision they make, send email to owled-steering@lists.webont.org explaining the situation and steering committee will mediate.

Failure to follow these policies will result in access to the project being suspended and files/pages with offending changes being reverted.
