      * Cardinality
      * Property chain inclusion
    * Datatype support
      * User defined etc.
    * Annotations and metamodelling
    * Syntactic Sugar
    * Tractable Fragments
    * Support from a number of W3C members

      * Director decision end September
      * October: members join
      * Telecons start end October
      * F2F end November+
  * Why Participate?
    * It's an opportunity to have a voice.
    * If there's stuff you don't like, pipe up!
  * Next Steps
    * Lobby your AC rep
    * Get your organisation to join
  * OWLEd and WG
    * Ensure that future OWLEd's provide a collective voice for the WG
    * Sandro: Can point out problems or point fixes from outside, but substantial stuff requires membership
  * Document Editors
    * Greater workload, but greater opportunity to contribute
  * Straw poll
    * Who would be interested in contributing?
      * Approx a dozen interested
      * 2 or 3 keen on joining W3C in order to participate.
    * Workshops as a precursor help to convince the W3C of the level of interest.
    * Restrictions on number of participants per member?
      * One who speaks for organisation. Can have others
    * F2F attendance?
      * Approx 10/12 would come
      * Typically 2 day meeting
      * W/c 25th November ok if not Monday
      * W/c 3rd December ok.
  * Bijan Remarks
    * Successful outcome. OWL progress had stopped. Wasn't clear that there would be fixes.
    * Charles: Is this a rolling process or a one shot OWL1.1 deal?
    * Sandro: OWL1.1
  * What happens next?
    * Further extensions
      * Some things might get channelled into the working group.
      * Often easier to channel through a WG rather than booting up again.
    * PFPS: Could end up with OWL1.1.x, e.g. adding stuff of a similar level to the OWL1.1 aspects. This is highly unlikely to be OWL2.0.
    * Sandro: Rolling groups (e.g. CSS) get recharted periodically.
    * Bijan: Could repeat the OWL1.1 process in terms of experience, requirements, implementation etc.
  * Tractable Fragments
    * Should this be a focus of the WG? Is it an integral part?
    * Allow vendors to target language fragments
    * Ruttenberg: Should sell them as useful fragments
    * Hawke: The fragments may be a distraction
    * Options
      * 1. WG in parallel
      * 2. WG deals, but delays
      * 3. External process/future WG
      * Most support for option 1.

## Features ##

  * List taken from papers
    * Often hard to know what you want until you've seen it.
    * Goal is to identify some of these things

## Process ##

  * How do we deal with the issue of features?
  * Currently an organic process
    * Ok until now
    * OWLEd too short and small
    * Informed decision needs clear signals
    * OWLEd
      * What the community wants
      * Whether the community likes it
  * Possible
    * Technically
    * Economically
    * Politically
  * Useful
    * Must have users
    * Features in real ontologies
    * Features enable applications
  * Attractive
    * Help grow the market
    * People should have good experiences
    * People shouldn't have bad experiences
  * Interesting
  * Requests
    * Report
      * Gather use cases and requirements. Gather information. Analysis of trade offs. Recruit prototypes
    * Proposal
      * Confidence in feature set. Detailed spec and experience
    * Specification
      * Design done and agreeable. Ready to use it in anger. Ready to take it to a standard body
