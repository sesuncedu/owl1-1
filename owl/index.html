<p>The W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL) is playing an important role in an increasing number and
range of applications, and is the focus of research into tools, reasoning techniques, formal
foundations and language extensions. This level of experience with OWL means that the community
is now in a good position to discuss how OWL be applied, adapted and extended to fulfil current
and future application demands. In particular, the initial design of OWL was conservative in
several ways: it excluded constructs that did not have considerable support from within the
W3C Web Ontology Working Group, or for which effective reasoning methods were not known or expected
to be shortly known.</p>

<p>At the First OWL: Experiences and Directions Workshop (held at Galway, Ireland, on November 11-12 2005),
the participants identified several restrictions of OWL that are problematic in many applications, and that
have been rendered unnecessary by recent theoretical advances in logic-based Knowledge Representation. As a
result of the workshop, an extension of OWL-DL was proposed. This extension, called OWL 1.1, is grounded on
the above mentioned theoretical advances, has a well defined model-theoretic semantics, and is motivated by
application requirements. The builders of the major Semantic Web reasoners, namely. RACER, FaCT++, Pellet
and Cerebra expressed a committment to support OWL 1.1 in the near future.</p>

<p>The sources of OWL 1.1 specification are hosted at
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/owl1-1/">http://code.google.com/p/owl1-1/</a>.

<h2>Tools that Support OWL 1.1:</h2>

<p>The following tools currently provide (prototypical) support for OWL 1.1
(thanks to Joanne Luciano for collecting this list):</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/download/prerelease-alpha/prototype.html">Protege</a></li>

  <li><a href="http://pellet.owldl.com/#Download">Pellet and SWOOP</a></li>

  <li><a href="http://owl.man.ac.uk/factplusplus">FaCT++</a></li>

  <li><a href="http://www.topbraidcomposer.com"> TopBraid Composer 2.0 </a>  </li>

</ul>

<p>Evren Sirin has kindly provided a sample OWL 1.1 <a href="http://www.owldl.com/ontologies/family.owl">ontology</a> to play with.</p>

<p>The specification of OWL 1.1, as well as other possible extensions of OWL DL are
currently being discussed through a
<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-owl-dev/">W3C mailing list</a>.
The usage of the <a href="http://lists.mindswap.org/mailman/listinfo/owl">old mailing list</a>
has been discontinued; the archive is, however, still available.</p>
